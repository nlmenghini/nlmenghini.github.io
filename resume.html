								<h3>About me</h3>
								<p>I am a passionate designer who enjoys exploring all creative graphic solutions for any design issue. I lean towards a clean, minimal aesthetic. I have a soft spot for grid based sensibilities and a passion for 
									typography. I also nerd out on icon systems and create them in my free time.</p><br/>
								<p>I spent my formative years living and traveling abroad; leading to adventures rooted in cultural exploration and experiencing different environments. It gives me a unique cultural perspective that I try to impart 
									onto my design philosophy.</p>

								<h3>Experience</h3>
								<h5><strong>UrbanBound</strong></h5>
								<p>UrbanBound is the leading Relocation Management Software provider, empowering companies and their relocating employees to administer, track, and optimize the relocation experience.  As the principle designer at 
									UrbanBound for the last 7 years my chief responsibility has been crafting the experience across our 5 applications (employee, employer, supplier, internal support staff, and administrative). To achieve desired 
									results I work closely with stakeholders and project managers to determine priorities; I design, prototype, and test concepts; I work closely with development to ensure that we are maintaining the high design 
									standards that our clients have come to enjoy from our apps.</p>
								</br>
									<p class="oblique">Senior Visual & Interaction Designer [June 2020 - Present]</p>
								<p>The move to a “senior” title has been about becoming the arbiter of design within the company; not just for the product. I now serve as the primary resource and  voice of the visual identity within UrbanBound. 
									In addition to my duties of serving as the UX/UI designer for 4 teams on the product I also work closely with  marketing and sales to keep the website, marketing material, sales material, and any supporting 
									products to ensure they all feel like UrbanBound.</p>
								</br>
									<p class="oblique">Product Designer [June 2016 - June 2020]</p>
								<p>The high growth, high yield years. These 4 years at UrbanBound are about growth and job management. The product team experienced intense change and growth; the department head changed, grew to 3 Product 
									Managers (one of them previously the senior designer), the development team grew 3 fold moving from a single team to 4, and a whole slew of process changes to boot. These 4 years helped me not only hone my design 
									skills but also my abilities to work across many tight deadlines and delivery product to an ever hungry development team.</p>
								</br>
									<p class="oblique">Associate Designer [ June 2013 - June 2016]</p>
								<p>The formative years. During these 3 years I gained experience with new design philosophies and practices, like design sprints; I started learning a new coding  language as we moved the application to React; I had 
									my first experience working with an outside firm during a major application redesign; I honed my UX/UI skill set with a growing list of client demands and the launch of a 4th application.</p>
								</br>
								<p class="oblique">Graphic Design Intern [Feb 2013 - June 2013]</p>
								<p>Learning to crawl and feeding the hunger. I came in as an intern primarily as marketing content creator. I helped make sale material, trade show material, and  supplementary material for the application. There was 
									a serious need for design help on the application so I offered to do that as well and I then became the marketing product designer. We needed a new website to keep up with all marketing material and app updates 
									so I did that as well. I found myself still creating marketing material, maintaining the website and working with the product team on UX/UI.</p>
								<h5><strong>Midwest Strength + Performance</strong></h5>
								<p class="oblique">Freelance Logo & Branding Design [Jan 2017 - March 2017]</p>
								<p>Midwest Strength + Performance is a strength and conditioning gym geared toward athletes and everyday individuals seeking a combined traditional and unconventional exercise routine. As an new business, the owners of MSP came to me looking to create a logo that reflected their values as individuals and what they wanted their gym to reflect. Competition in the market is primarily CrossFit gyms so it had to feel relatable but distinct enough as an offering in the fitness space. Drawing inspiration form the Rudyard Kipling poem “The Law for the Wolves” a wolf head was adopted as the mark and over the course of 3 revisions a logo (mark + type) was delivered along with additional supporting graphics and typography for use on the digital or physical products.</p>
								<h5><strong>Oklahoma State University</strong></h5>
								<p class="oblique">Lab Technician [May 2011- May 2012]</p>
								<p>Oklahoma State University has a substantial art department that includes 3 computer labs. As  technician it was my job to maintain the equipment in those labs;  make sure the Macs and software were updated; printers were always running; assist anyone in the labs with usage of the Macs; teach any new students of  professors on new or existing programs. The benefit of this position was I gained early experience on educating others on design principles and communicating  difficult concepts to people less versed than I was; skills that have translated when trying to communicate new concepts or product ideas to people outside the product department.</p>

							<h3>Employee Timeline</h3>

						<div class="col col-8 copy">
							<p>The employee timeline is a collection of the various tasks and events that happen during the course of the relocation. A driving goal behind the timeline project was to bring order to the relocation process for both employees and their consultant.</p>
							<p>I choose a more traditional timeline to provide a guided experience for employees, with steps to follow and the means to track progress. Adding a new flyout in the consultant app gave them the ability to check in on progress and create tasks and events.</p>

							<h3>Standardized Reporting</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="col col-8 copy">
							<p>The project  aimed at completely rebuilding our employer reporting system. The current system made it hard to make copies of reports, save filter sets, and schedule exports.</p>
							<p>We already knew the core set of reports that we would offer. I did some initial design exploration to help narrow down the possible columns and filters for each report. The card based reports page provides an easy, scannable 
								interface with a limit set of reports. I designed the reports around a notion of versioning to kill the clutter of endless copies. An employer user can save any number of data sets and filters as a version. Once saved an employer can schedule any number of exports for that version.</p>

							<h3>Relocation Plan</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="col col-8 copy">
							<p>A relocation is long and complicated process. At the center is a policy that drives what an employee can do, how we can help them, and how much an employer wants to spend.</p>
							<p>The challenge with the plan was that each user has different needs from the same set of information. The employee app I focused on managing the budget and reviewing/booking services. The consultant app I focused on the ability 
								to provide guidance. The employer app I focused on highlighting the spend of the move.</p>

						<div class="col col-8 copy">
							<p>The relocation consultant app was born out of a painful fragmented process. Between email, phone calls, and a poor data admin interface consultants administered moves as best they could.</p>
							<p>I designed a full system that would be appealing from consultants to use long term to administer a move. The column layout provides complete control of the information they need to see at any point.</p>

							<p>The Order and Leads Management System (OLMS) is a refresh of UrbanBound's existing supplier application. The focus was to create a new order process that would allow suppliers to create many cost estimates for a single order.</p>
							<p>During the design process I focused on a modular system that would allow us to fine tune the order form and the employee display. The form and the display can handle any permutation estimate options, default form line items, or the

							<p>While my teammates figured out the proper math and back end coding, I prototyped the calculator. My goal was to keep with the spirit of transparency. The more information you provide the more accurate your estimate becomes. Even
