								<h3>So who are you?</h3>
								<p>I’m a designer. Product Designer by paid profession but designer by passion. I get excited by all facets of design, digital and physical, especially typography. I like things clean. My coworkers call my never-ending pursuit of pixel 
									perfection “Nick-picking” and a professor once called my designs “engineered”. This love of design and desire for cleanliness intersect nicely for me in  software.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mix introduction col col-6 category-1" data-value="2" style="display: inline-block;">
								<h3>What do you do currently?</h3>
								<p>I work at UrbanBound; a Relocation Management Software provider. We help companies move employee from A to B and we do it through a carefully crafted experience delivered across 5 web applications. As part of an amazing product team I 
									help to create and maintain  the visual identity and  experience of those applications. I’ve been designing and growing at UrbanBound for 7 years now and I have enjoyed every min.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mix introduction col col-6 category-1" data-value="3" style="display: inline-block;">
								<h3>Why leave a good job after 7 years?</h3>
								<p>I’ve had a wonderful run at UrbanBound. I’ve learned quite a lot over 7 years working here. Seen loads of personal and career growth, tackled many challenges, and taken on new responsibilities each and every year. But, it is time to 
									test out what I’ve learned in a new space. I’m ready for that next step and it feels right to take it when things at a high point.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mix introduction col col-6 category-1" data-value="4" style="display: inline-block;">
								<h3>Why hire someone willing to leave a good job?</h3>
								<p>Why wait to leave when the job is no longer desirable? I’m choosing to leave because the opportunity to work for one of the best doesn’t come around often. I think my skill set that has come as a result of working hard with a group of 
									creative people, at a company that wants creative people is exactly what I want to take to Basecamp. I want to start the new chapter in my career and test my mettle.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mix introduction col col-6 category-1" data-value="5" style="display: inline-block;">
								<h3>So why this job?</h3>
								<p>Getting past the fact that working at Basecamp is a career goal for lots of people my driving interest is working on HEY. I joined UrbanBound 7 years ago because they were setting out to solve the unpleasant experience that is moving. 
									Having moved a far amount in my life I felt that pain and it resonated with me. I want to work on products that reinvent and refresh old ways of thinking. The chance to work on HEY and other Basecamp products offers that exact opportunity.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mix introduction col col-6 category-1" data-value="6" style="display: inline-block;">
								<h3>OK, so what are we getting?</h3>
								<p>A Swiss army knife. Your application says you hire a product designer that can do it all. For years at UrbanBound I’ve been doing the bulk of UX, UI, and front end development. Throw in a good amount of QA and design for other areas of the 
									business and you would get a designer that can do a great many things if you need him to.</p>
								<p>You are also getting somebody who wants this job. I’m very happy at UrbanBound. I enjoy the people I work with across the company. I saw this 
									posting and it excited all the parts of me that derive enjoyment from my current working environment. The opportunity to make change, to work with a great cast of people, to create and build clean, compelling, intuitive, designs. I 
									think Basecamp is the opportunity to preserve everything I currently love about work and gain so much more.</p>

								<h3>Bonus round</h3>
								<h5><strong>Some personal details</strong></h5>
								<p>I live in Maryland with my wife Laura. I enjoy a wide variety of activities both indoor and outdoor. My core set of extracurriculars include city exploration (typically in the form of dining establishments), gaming (tabletop and video), 
									photography (mostly macro), hiking, and basketball. I love to travel as well although not as often as I’d like; this comes from growing up in Dubai and my mother being Norwegian. If I had to pick a super power it would be never sleeping 
									so that I could do more with my time.</p>
								<h5><strong>Favorite quotes</strong></h5>
								<p class="oblique">"Simplicity is about subtracting the obvious and adding the meaningful."</br>~ John Maeda</p>
								<p>John Maeda says a fair amount of controversial things about UX/UI work but I still find lots of wisdom in his teachings. I agree with lots of his sentiments around a “less is more” mentality and that design should always serve a purpose. 
									All designers want to make cool things but it’s not that cool if it isn’t very functional.</p>
								<p class="oblique">"A day spent without the sight or sound of beauty, the contemplation of mystery, or the search of truth or perfection is a poverty-stricken day..."</br>~ Lewis Mumford</p>
								<p>My father loves quotes and this was one he liked to repeat often. I think it’s a good reminder to slow down each day. Truly appreciate what you have. In an age were media consumption happens so fast it’s easy to see nothing but sad of depressing news and lose sight that there is still plenty good.</p>

								<h3>Experience</h3>
								<h5><strong>UrbanBound</strong></h5>
								<p>UrbanBound is the leading Relocation Management Software provider, empowering companies and their relocating employees to administer, track, and optimize the relocation experience.  As the principle designer at 
									UrbanBound for the last 7 years my chief responsibility has been crafting the experience across our 5 applications (employee, employer, supplier, internal support staff, and administrative). To achieve desired 
									results I work closely with stake holders and project managers to determine priorities; I design, prototype, and test concepts; I work closely with development to ensure that we are maintaining the high design 
									standards that our clients have come to enjoy from our apps.</p>
								<p class="oblique">Senior Visual & Interaction Designer [June 2020 - Present]</p>
								<p>The move to a “senior” title has been about becoming the arbiter of design within the company; not just for the product. I now serve as the primary resource and  voice of the visual identity within UrbanBound. 
									In addition to my duties of serving as the UX/UI designer for 4 teams on the product I also work closely with  marketing and sales to keep the website, marketing material, sales material, and any supporting 
									products to ensure they all feel like UrbanBound.</p>
								<p class="oblique">Product Designer [June 2016 - June 2020]</p>
								<p>The high growth, high yield years. These 4 years are UrbanBound are about growth and job management. The product team experienced intense change and growth; the department head changed, grew to 3 Product 
									Managers (one of them previously the senior designer), the development team grew 3 fold moving from a single team to 4, and a whole slew of process changes to boot. These 4 years helped me not only hone my design 
									skills but also my abilities to work across many tight deadlines and delivery product to an ever hungry development team.</p>
								<p class="oblique">Associate Designer [ June 2013 - June 2016]</p>
								<p>The formative years. During these 3 years I gained experience with new design philosophies and practices, like design sprints; I started learning a new coding  language as we moved the application to React; I had 
									my first experience working with an outside firm during a major application redesign; I honed my UX/UI skill set with a growing list of client demands and the launch of a 4th application.</p>
								<p class="oblique">Graphic Design Intern [Feb 2013 - June 2013]</p>
								<p>Learning to crawl and feeding the hunger. I came in as an intern primarily as marketing content creator. I helped make sale material, trade show material, and  supplementary material for the application. There was 
									a serious need for design help on the application so I offered to do that as well and I then became the marketing product designer. We needed a new website to keep up with all marketing material and app updates 
									so I did that as well. I found myself still creating marketing material, maintaining the website and working with the product team on UX/UI.</p>
								<h5><strong>Midwest Strength + Performance</strong></h5>
								<p class="oblique">Freelance Logo & Branding Design [Jan 2017 - March 2017]</p>
								<p>Midwest Strength + Performance is a strength and conditioning gym geared toward athletes and everyday individuals seeking a combined traditional and unconventional exercise routine. As an new business, the owners of MSP came to me looking to create a logo that reflected their values as individuals and what they wanted their gym to reflect. Competition in the market is primarily cross-fit gyms so it had to feel relatable but distinct enough as an offering in the fitness space. Drawing inspiration form the Rudyard Kipling poem “The Law for the Wolves” a wolves head was adopted as the mark and over the course of 3 revisions a logo (mark + type) was delivered along with additional supporting graphics and typography for use on the digital or physical products.</p>
								<h5><strong>Oklahoma State University</strong></h5>
								<p class="oblique">Lab Technician [May 2011- May 2012]</p>
								<p>Oklahoma State University has a substantial art department that includes 3 computer labs. As  technician it was my job to maintain the equipment in those labs;  make sure the Macs and software were updated; printers were always running; assist anyone in the labs with usage of the Macs; teach any new students of  professors on new or existing programs. The benefit of this position was I gained early experience on educating others on design principles and communicating  difficult concepts to people less versed than I was; skills that have translated when trying to communicate new concepts or product ideas to people outside the product department.</p>
