								<h3>1. So who are you?</h3>
								<p>I’m a designer; Product Designer by paid profession, designer by passion. I get excited by all facets of design; digital and physical, especially typography. I like things clean, clear, and orderly. My coworkers call my 
									pursuit of pixel perfection “Nick-picking.” My professors called my designs “engineered.” That love of design and desire for simple grid based layouts intersect for me in software.</p>
								<div class="arrow-1"></div>
								<h3>2. What do you do currently?</h3>
								<p>I work at UrbanBound; a Relocation Management Software provider. We help companies move employees and we do it through a tailored experience across 5 web applications. I create and maintain the visual identity and experience of 
									those applications. I’ve been designing and growing at UrbanBound for 7 years now and I very much enjoy it.</p>
								<div class="arrow-2"></div>
								<h3>3. Why leave a good job after 7 years?</h3>
								<p>I'm having a wonderful run at UrbanBound. I’ve learned quite a lot in the 7 years working here.  Each year I experience personal and professional growth, tackle new challenges, and take on responsibility.  The time has come to 
									test out what I’ve learned in a new space. I’m ready for that next step and it feels right to take it when things are at a high point. Basecamp is that next step for me.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="mix introduction col col-6 category-1" data-value="4" style="display: inline-block;">
								<h3>4. Why hire someone willing to leave a good job?</h3>
								<p>Why wait until the job is no longer desirable? I’m choosing to leave because the opportunity to work for one of the best doesn’t come around often. My skill set that has come as a result of hard work with creative people 
									is exactly what I want to bring to Basecamp. I want to start the new chapter in my career and test my mettle.</p>
								<div class="arrow-3"></div>
								<h3>5. So why this job?</h3>
								<p>Moving past the fact that jobs at Basecamp are highly sought after, my driving interest is working on HEY. I joined UrbanBound because they aim to solve the unpleasant experience of moving. I know that pain having moved a fair amount 
									in my life and it resonated with me. I want to work on products that reinvent and refresh old ways of thinking. The chance to work on HEY and other Basecamp products offers that exact opportunity.</p>
								<div class="arrow-4"></div>
								<h3>6. OK, so what are we getting?</h3>
								<p>A Swiss army knife. Your application says you hire a product designer that can do it all. For years I’ve been doing the bulk of UX, UI, and a fair bit of front end development at UrbanBound . Throw in a good amount of QA and design 
									for other areas of the business and you would get a designer that can do a great many things if you need him to.</p>
								<br/>
								<p>You get somebody who wants the opportunity to make change.  Somebody who wants to work with a great cast of people.  Somebody who wants to create and build clean, compelling, intuitive designs. I saw this posting and it excited all 
									the parts of me that enjoy my current working environment and then some. Basecamp is the opportunity to preserve everything I currently love about work and gain so much more.</p>
								<div class="arrow-5"></div>
							</div>
							<div class="mix introduction col col-12 category-1" data-value="7" style="display: inline-block;">
								<h3>Bonus round</h3>
								<h5><strong>Some personal details</strong></h5>
								<p>I live in Maryland with my wife Laura. I enjoy a wide variety of activities both indoor and outdoor. Some of which include city exploration, gaming, macro photography, hiking, and basketball. I love to travel, although not as 
									often as I’d like. This passion comes from growing up in Dubai and my mother being Norwegian. If I had to pick a super power it would be never sleeping so that I could do more with my time.</p>
								<h5><strong>Favorite quotes</strong></h5>
								<p class="oblique">"Simplicity is about subtracting the obvious and adding the meaningful."</br>~ John Maeda</p>
								<p>John Maeda says a fair amount of controversial things about UX/UI work, but I still find lots of wisdom in his teachings. I agree with his “less is more” mentality and that design should always serve a purpose.  
									All designers want to make cool things but they aren't that cool if they aren't functional. </p>
								</br>
								<p class="oblique">"A day spent without the sight or sound of beauty, the contemplation of mystery, or the search of truth or perfection is a poverty-stricken day..."</br>~ Lewis Mumford</p>
								<p>My father loves quotes and this is one he repeats often. It is a good reminder to slow down each day; truly appreciate what you have. In an age were consumption happens so fast it is easy to lose sight of what matters.</p>

								<h3>Experience</h3>
								<h5><strong>UrbanBound</strong></h5>
								<p>UrbanBound is the leading Relocation Management Software provider, empowering companies and their relocating employees to administer, track, and optimize the relocation experience.  As the principle designer at 
									UrbanBound for the last 7 years my chief responsibility has been crafting the experience across our 5 applications (employee, employer, supplier, internal support staff, and administrative). To achieve desired 
									results I work closely with stakeholders and project managers to determine priorities; I design, prototype, and test concepts; I work closely with development to ensure that we are maintaining the high design 
									standards that our clients have come to enjoy from our apps.</p>
								</br>
									<p class="oblique">Senior Visual & Interaction Designer [June 2020 - Present]</p>
								<p>The move to a “senior” title has been about becoming the arbiter of design within the company; not just for the product. I now serve as the primary resource and  voice of the visual identity within UrbanBound. 
									In addition to my duties of serving as the UX/UI designer for 4 teams on the product I also work closely with  marketing and sales to keep the website, marketing material, sales material, and any supporting 
									products to ensure they all feel like UrbanBound.</p>
								</br>
									<p class="oblique">Product Designer [June 2016 - June 2020]</p>
								<p>The high growth, high yield years. These 4 years at UrbanBound are about growth and job management. The product team experienced intense change and growth; the department head changed, grew to 3 Product 
									Managers (one of them previously the senior designer), the development team grew 3 fold moving from a single team to 4, and a whole slew of process changes to boot. These 4 years helped me not only hone my design 
									skills but also my abilities to work across many tight deadlines and delivery product to an ever hungry development team.</p>
								</br>
									<p class="oblique">Associate Designer [ June 2013 - June 2016]</p>
								<p>The formative years. During these 3 years I gained experience with new design philosophies and practices, like design sprints; I started learning a new coding  language as we moved the application to React; I had 
									my first experience working with an outside firm during a major application redesign; I honed my UX/UI skill set with a growing list of client demands and the launch of a 4th application.</p>
								</br>
								<p class="oblique">Graphic Design Intern [Feb 2013 - June 2013]</p>
								<p>Learning to crawl and feeding the hunger. I came in as an intern primarily as marketing content creator. I helped make sale material, trade show material, and  supplementary material for the application. There was 
									a serious need for design help on the application so I offered to do that as well and I then became the marketing product designer. We needed a new website to keep up with all marketing material and app updates 
									so I did that as well. I found myself still creating marketing material, maintaining the website and working with the product team on UX/UI.</p>
								<h5><strong>Midwest Strength + Performance</strong></h5>
								<p class="oblique">Freelance Logo & Branding Design [Jan 2017 - March 2017]</p>
								<p>Midwest Strength + Performance is a strength and conditioning gym geared toward athletes and everyday individuals seeking a combined traditional and unconventional exercise routine. As an new business, the owners of MSP came to me looking to create a logo that reflected their values as individuals and what they wanted their gym to reflect. Competition in the market is primarily CrossFit gyms so it had to feel relatable but distinct enough as an offering in the fitness space. Drawing inspiration form the Rudyard Kipling poem “The Law for the Wolves” a wolf head was adopted as the mark and over the course of 3 revisions a logo (mark + type) was delivered along with additional supporting graphics and typography for use on the digital or physical products.</p>
								<h5><strong>Oklahoma State University</strong></h5>
								<p class="oblique">Lab Technician [May 2011- May 2012]</p>
								<p>Oklahoma State University has a substantial art department that includes 3 computer labs. As  technician it was my job to maintain the equipment in those labs;  make sure the Macs and software were updated; printers were always running; assist anyone in the labs with usage of the Macs; teach any new students of  professors on new or existing programs. The benefit of this position was I gained early experience on educating others on design principles and communicating  difficult concepts to people less versed than I was; skills that have translated when trying to communicate new concepts or product ideas to people outside the product department.</p>

							<p>The employee timeline is a collection of the various tasks and events that happen during the course of the relocation. A driving goal behind the timeline project was to bring order to the relocation process for both employees and their consultant.</p>
							<p>I choose a more traditional timeline to provide a guided experience for employees, with steps to follow and the means to track progress. Adding a new flyout in the consultant app gave them the ability to check in on progress and create tasks and events.</p>

							<h3>Standardized Reporting</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="col col-8 copy">
							<p>The project  aimed at completely rebuilding our employer reporting system. The current system made it hard to make copies of reports, save filter sets, and schedule exports.</p>
							<p>We already knew the core set of reports that we would offer. I did some initial design exploration to help narrow down the possible columns and filters for each report. The card based reports page provides an easy, scannable 
								interface with a limit set of reports. I designed the reports around a notion of versioning to kill the clutter of endless copies. An employer user can save any number of data sets and filters as a version. Once saved an employer can schedule any number of exports for that version.</p>

							<h3>Relocation Plan</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="col col-8 copy">
							<p>A relocation is long and complicated process. At the center is a policy that drives what an employee can do, how we can help them, and how much an employer wants to spend.</p>
							<p>The challenge with the plan was that each user has different needs from the same set of information. The employee app I focused on managing the budget and reviewing/booking services. The consultant app I focused on the ability 
								to provide guidance. The employer app I focused on highlighting the spend of the move.</p>
